All sprites and other assets are by me, some of them are based off of characters from Five Nights at Freddy's - Five Nights at Freddy's and its characters are copyright of Scott Cawthon and I in no way claim ownership or affiliation with property and characters.

Not really an asset but the game is a fan game of Five Nights at Freddy's and as such includes characters and iconography from the series or inspired iconography, I claim to not own any of these characters or sets. I am in no way affiliated with Scott Cawthon or his partners and all credit goes out to him and his partners for making these amazing games
